            <p>
                Artisan’s small groups, called "Greenhouses", are a place where Artisans can
                <i>grow together toward authentic faith</i>. Greenhouses are for people who
                are looking to deepen their connection with God and each other. Each week,
                groups will read scripture, engage in conversation about faith,
                and share in a common spiritual practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Groups will meet weekly for 10 weeks, with a 3-week evaluation period during
                which attendees can decide whether or not to commit for the full session.
                Groups will be held in several locations in and around the city of Rochester,
                so get in touch to sign up today! Click on any leader’s name to send them
                an email for the specific location and more information.
            </p>
