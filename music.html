            <h1>Music</h1>

            <p>
                We love modern music and employ lots of different styles, with
                most of our arrangements landing somewhere between rock and
                alt-folk. We currently have three different bands that play on a
                scheduled rotation. Guest musicians and impromptu lineups are
                common.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also love the theological and lyrical depth of hymns, both old
                and new. Our worship repertoire is made up of classic hymns and
                the best modern songs of faith.
            </p>

            <p>
                And finally, we engage music as an art form that helps us
                encounter God, not just with its textual content but also with its
                sonic beauty. Sometimes, worship means listening as well as
                singing.
