            <h1>Groups Overview</h1>

            <p>
                Groups are a setting where we can work together to live out
                Artisanâ€™s values in a smaller, more intimate context.
                We have three types of groups that accomplish this goal in different ways:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our <a href="/home-groups/">home groups</a> are our most common type of groups.
                    They tend to be ongoing groups where people get to know each other more deeply
                    through sharing, prayer, and reading the Bible together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our <a href="/connection-groups/">connection groups</a> are occasional,
                    short-term gatherings where people spend time together doing something fun,
                    such as watching movies, playing games, brewing beer, or sampling foods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our <a href="/study-groups/">study groups</a> are where we go deeper
                    in studying scripture, theology, spiritual disciplines, and culture.
                    Typically led by a person with some expertise and/or knowledge,
                    study groups happen a few times per year.
                </li>
            </ul>
