            <h1>Giving</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Donate quickly and securely using our
                <a href="https://artisanchurch.ccbchurch.com/login.php?rurl=trx_give.php" target="_blank">online giving service</a>,
                hosted at CCBChurch.com.
            </p>

            <p>If you’ve never used this system before, it’s simple to sign up.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create an account for yourself. (Church Community Builder accounts are for individuals,
                    but don’t worry, your donation will roll into your household donation totals.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide your checking account or card information and specify whether
                    you want to give once or set up a recurring donation.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>

            <p>There are several benefits to online giving for both you and Artisan.</p>

                    <dd>
                        You will not need to remember if you gave this month or
                        need to mail offering checks when you are out of town.

                    <dd>
                        Online giving is more secure than giving by cash or check,
                        because an electronic gift can’t be lost or stolen.

                        Creating an account with Church Community Builder allows you to log in and

                        Online contributions require less processing from our administrative staff,
                        since the information is logged and deposited automatically.

                <h1>Why give to the church?</h1>
                <p>
                    In one sense, giving to Artisan might be similar to giving to any other non-profit:
                    if you believe in our mission and our calling, you should give!
                    100% of our funding comes from the generosity of people who believe in our ministry.
                    But as people of faith, we also consider giving to the church
                    to be <em>an act of worship</em> – sharing the gifts that God has given us
                    with the larger community he is building in and through us.
                    Thanking God for his provision in our lives, we pray that those who give would be
                    shaped by their generous sacrifice, and that he would bless and multiply
                    the gifts that are given in such a way that we would see his kingdom
                    become a reality on earth as it is in heaven.
