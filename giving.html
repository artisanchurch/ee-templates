            <h1>Giving</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Donate quickly and securely using our
                <a href="https://acrocny.infellowship.com/onlinegiving" target="_blank">online
                giving service</a>, hosted at InFellowship.com.
            </p>

            <p>If you’ve never used this system before, it’s simple to sign up.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create an account for yourself. (InFellowship accounts are for individuals,
                    but don’t worry, your donation will roll into your household donation totals.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide your checking account or card information and specify whether
                    you want to give once or set up a recurring donation.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>

            <p>There are several benefits to online giving for both you and Artisan.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Simplicity</dt>
                    <dd>
                        No more forgetting to bring your cash or check on Sunday morning,
                        or forgetting to mail your gift or catch up later if you miss a week.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Security</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Online giving is more secure than giving by cash or check in that
                        an electronic gift can’t be lost or stolen.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Online Statements</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Creating an account with InFellowship allows you to log in and
                        view your household’s giving—whether you donated online or at church.
                    </dd>

                    <dd>
                        Online contributions require less processing from our administrative staff,
                        since the information is logged and deposited automatically.
                    </dd>

            <h2>Our Policies</h2>

            <p>
                Your information is held securely by the InFellowship system.
                This information will remain private and will never be given away to third parties,
                other than to process your scheduled contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can schedule new contributions at any time and can modify or cancel
                those contributions at any time prior to the date they are scheduled.
                Once the contribution has been processed, however, it cannot be canceled.
            </p>
