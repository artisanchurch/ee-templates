                <h1>Core Affirmations</h1>
                <p>
                    Our first desire is to follow in the “ancient paths” of the generous orthodoxy revealed
                    in Scripture, affirmed in the consensual creeds of the early church, and embodied in the
                    life of Jesus’ followers throughout time and across cultures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet we equally recognize Christ’s call to contextualize his gospel – <em>without</em>
                    compromising its core – by providing “new wineskins” that will allow the effervescent
                    work of God’s Spirit to reach its full-bodied potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These simple statements are our humble attempt at articulating God’s vision for his
                    church at Artisan as we partner with his redemptive purposes.
                </p>

                <h1>Our Affiliation</h1>
                <p>
                    We were launched in 2005 as an official church plant of the Evangelical Covenant Church,
                    and continue to be part of this wonderful family of churches.
                    They provide resources, encouragement, and accountability.
