            <p>
                Our worship gatherings last about 90 minutes and
                blend modern content into an ancient, four-fold
                <a href="/liturgy/">liturgical pattern</a>:
                Gathering – Word – Table – Sending Forth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some of the elements you might experience in one of our
                gatherings: scripture read aloud, a creed recited together,
                meditative prayer, confessional prayer, congregational prayer,
                <a href="/music/">old hymns and new worship songs arranged by
                one of our bands in a variety of modern musical styles</a>,
                silence, noise, art, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each service includes an engaging teaching on a scripture text or
                topic, followed by the sacrament of Communion—open to all
                those who seek to follow Jesus.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the sermon, we offer wonderful
                <a href="/children/">age-appropriate ministry for children ages 0–9</a>.
                Parents and caregivers are always welcome to keep their children
                with them in our sanctuary for the entire service if they prefer.
            </p>
