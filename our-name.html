            <h1>Why “Artisan” Church?</h1>

            <h2>What’s in a name?</h2>

            <p>
                The name “Artisan Church” beautifully expresses our desire to creatively live out the
                mission God has given us to encounter God, embrace people, and engage culture, in the
                way of Jesus. The imagery is inspired by the apostle Paul, who wrote:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
                    prepared in advance for us to do.”
                </p>
                <cite>
                    – {exp:verse_url}Ephesians 2:10{/exp:verse_url}
                </cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                God is the “master artisan,” creating everything – including us – to be part of his
                redemptive design. We are simply called to be faithful apprentices of Jesus, to do the
                good work of sharing his blessings with our friends, family, neighbors, community, and
                world. You’re welcome to join us on that journey!
            </p>

            <h2>A bit of history: from two church planting teams to one vibrant community!</h2>

            <p>
                Artisan Church had its start in the wonderful church planting teams
                formerly know as Capax Dei Church and Quest Church.
                These two groups were well on their way to fully launching separately
                when God brought an even more ambitious plan into focus. Although both projects were
                moving forward, neither felt quite “complete.” Each group had something unique to offer,
                not only in its gifts and talents, but also in the core communities it served. Yet the
                mission and vision were strikingly similar, almost identical: a strong calling to be a
                church for greater Rochester, yet centered in the southeast quadrant of the city; a fresh
                approach to expressing the Christian faith for a postmodern world while staying true to
                the Gospel; valuing art and creativity; seeking justice; sharing new life in the Way of
                Jesus&hellip; and the list goes on.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, in February 2005, the two teams came together, and Artisan
                Church was born. Over the summer we continued to flesh out the
                “launch team” and ministry areas as we headed toward our fall “Grand
                Opening.” By God’s grace, in October 2005 we were successfully
                launched, and have continued to experience wonderful growth, both in
                the depth of lives changed, and in the breadth of many new people
                finding a place of welcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                With this growth comes wonderful opportunities, real challenges, and even
                greater responsibility to truly make a difference in people’s lives, our
                city, and the world. We’re humbled by what God is doing in and through his
                people at Artisan. So now you join the story already in progress. We’d love
                to have you come explore and be part of the adventure!
            </p>
