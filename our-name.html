            <h1>Why “Artisan” Church?</h1>

            <h2>What’s in a name?</h2>

            <p>
                The name “Artisan Church” beautifully expresses our desire to creatively live out the
                mission God has given us to encounter God, embrace people, and engage culture, in the
                way of Jesus. The imagery is inspired by the apostle Paul, who wrote:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
                    prepared in advance for us to do.”
                </p>
                <cite>
                    – {exp:verse_url}Ephesians 2:10{/exp:verse_url}
                </cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                God is the “master artisan,” creating everything – including us – to be part of his
                redemptive design. We are simply called to be faithful apprentices of Jesus, to do the
                good work of sharing his blessings with our friends, family, neighbors, community, and
                world. You’re welcome to join us on that journey!
            </p>

            <h2>A bit of history</h2>

            <p>
                Artisan Church had its start in 2005, when two church planting teams came together
                to form one church. These teams, known as Capax Dei Church and Quest Covenant Church,
                had strikingly similar visions, yet each also had something unique to offer, not only
                in its gifts and talents, but also in the core communities it served.
            </p>

            <p>
                So throughout 2005, Artisan Church was successfully launched and experienced steady
                growth, both in the depth of lives changed, and in the breadth of many new people
                finding a place of welcome. With this growth has come wonderful opportunities, real
                challenges, and even greater responsibility to truly make a difference in people’s
                lives, our city, and the world. We’re humbled by what God is doing in and through his
                people at Artisan. We’d love to have you come explore and be part of the adventure!
            </p>
