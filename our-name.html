            <h1>Why “Artisan” Church?</h1>

            <h2>What’s in a name?</h2>

            <p>
                The name “Artisan Church” beautifully expresses our desire to creatively live out the
                mission God has given us to encounter God, embrace people, and engage culture, in the
                way of Jesus. The imagery is inspired by the apostle Paul, who wrote:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
                    prepared in advance for us to do.”
                </p>
                <cite>
                    – {exp:verse_url}Ephesians 2:10{/exp:verse_url}
                </cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                God is the “master artisan,” creating everything – including us – to be part of his
                redemptive design. We are simply called to be faithful apprentices of Jesus, to do the
                good work of sharing his blessings with our friends, family, neighbors, community, and
                world. You’re welcome to join us on that journey!
            </p>
