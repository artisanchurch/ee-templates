                <p>
                    Artisan small groups are a way for us to live out the
                    <a href="/about/">mission and values</a> of our church
                    in a smaller, more relational setting, where it is easier
                    to explore faith and spirituality at your own pace.
                    We would love to have you get involved with one today!
                    Most of our groups are open to new members;
                    check the group list for more information on getting involved
                    and the contact person for each group.
                </p>
