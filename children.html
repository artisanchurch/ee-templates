            <h1>Children’s activities on Sunday mornings</h1>

            <p>
                We would love to have your family join us for one of our Sunday morning services!
                Families are always welcome to stay together in the sanctuary for the entire service,
                or kids can take part in our programming during the sermon portion.
                Children are typically invited to take part in programming beginning at
                the passing of the peace and are picked up by parents during communion.
            </p>

            <h2>Seedlings (Infants)</h2>
            <p>
                We have an infant care room available for parents or caregivers to use any time.
                The room is filled with everything needed to care for an infant
                in a quiet setting – baby toys, glider chairs, a changing table, etc.
                {!-- The service can be heard on speakers in this room. --}
                {!-- and volunteers we call "Baby Holders" who would be happy to
                care for your infant during the sermon time of our service! --}
                Babies are also always welcome in the service.
            </p>

            <h2>Sprouts (Toddlers – Ages 1–3)</h2>
            <p>
                Our toddlers explore Bible stories each week through play.
                We have wonderful, caring volunteers who help kids to get used to
                being dropped off and help them engage in group activities.
            </p>

            <h2>The Garden (Pre-K – 3rd Grade)</h2>
            <p>
                In the Garden, children explore a different Bible story each month
                through a variety of workshops. Each week they engage in the story
                through art, science, music, cooking, film, and more!
            </p>
