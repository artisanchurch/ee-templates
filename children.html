            <h1>Children & Families</h1>

            <p>
                We would love to have your family join us for a Sunday morning service!
                Children are always welcome to stay in the sanctuary with their parents
                for the entire service, or can take part in our programming during the
                sermon portion of our service.
                Children are typically invited to take part in programming beginning at
                the passing of the peace and are picked up by parents during communion.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Seedlings (Birth – 24 months)
            </h2>

            <p>
                For our littlest ones, we have a “baby care” room located across from the sanctuary.
                Parents are welcome to stay and care for their babies in a room suited just for
                them or can leave them with our wonderful volunteers, most of whom are parents,
                during the sermon time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The room is filled with age appropriate toys, a changing table,
                and glider rocking chairs perfect for nursing moms.
                (We ask that you remove your shoes as you enter in order to
                keep the room as clean as possible for crawlers!)
            </p>

            <p>
                Don’t forget – children of all ages (and nursing moms!)
                are always welcome in the sanctuary, as well!
            </p>

            <h2>
                Sprouts (2 & 3 year olds)
            </h2>

            <p>
                The Sprouts meet at the end of our children’s ministry hall in the “green room.”
                They use  curriculum that is designed just for their age and stage
                and are led by wonderful, caring teachers and helpers.
                Each week they sing, play, color, and hear short interactive stories
                as they get acquainted with the Bible!
            </p>

            <h2>
                Buds (3 & 4 year olds)
            </h2>

            <p>
                The Bud class gathers in the “large room” in our kids wing, along with the Bloom class,
                to participate in a fun group music experience to start off our time together.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, we close the divider in the classroom and the Buds,
                led by a caring teacher and adult helper, explore stories in the Bible.
                We use the Jesus Storybook Bible and engage with scripture through music, play, and art.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Blooms (K–3rd Grade)
            </h2>

            <p>
                The Bloom class gathers in the “large room” in our kids wing, along with the Bud class,
                to participate in a fun group music experience to start off our time together.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, we close the divider in the classroom and the Blooms,
                led by an experienced teacher, explore stories in the Bible.
                We use the Jesus Storybook Bible and engage with scripture
                through music, play, drama, and art.
