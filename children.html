            <h1>Children & Families</h1>

            <p>
                We would love to have your family join us for a Sunday morning service!
                Children are always welcome to stay in the sanctuary with their parents
                for the entire service, or can take part in our programming during the
                sermon portion of our service.
                Children are typically invited to take part in programming beginning at
                the passing of the peace and are picked up by parents during communion.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Seedlings (Infants)
            </h2>

            <p>
                We have an infant care room available for parents to use,
                and volunteers we call "Baby Holders" who would be happy to
                care for your infant during the sermon time of our service!
            </p>

            <p>
                The room is filled with age appropriate toys, a changing table,
                and glider rocking chairs perfect for nursing moms.
                (We ask that you remove your shoes as you enter in order to
                keep the room as clean as possible for crawlers!)
            </p>

            <p>
                Don’t forget – children of all ages (and nursing moms!)
                are always welcome in the sanctuary, as well!
            </p>

            <h2>
                Sprouts (Toddlers)
            </h2>

            <p>
                Our toddlers have a special class of their own, with caring volunteers
                who explore a Bible story with them and spend lots of time playing together!
            </p>

            <h2>
                The Garden (Pre-K – 3rd Grade)
            </h2>

            <p>
                In the Garden, kids explore a different Bible story each month through a variety of workshops.
                Each week they engage in the story through art, science, music, cooking, film, and more!
            </p>
