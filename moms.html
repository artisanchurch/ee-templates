            <p>
                Our moms (and grandmas, babysitters, etc.) group meets Wednesday mornings
                from 10:00-11:30 am at the church building.
                Moms are invited to bring their little ones for open play in the sanctuary,
                where we have all different types of play equipment set up,
                and then send kiddos down the hall (if they would like to)
                for a fun play and music time led by a wonderful music teacher.
                While kids play and sing, moms can grab a cup of coffee
                and a snack and enjoy some adult conversation!
            </p>
